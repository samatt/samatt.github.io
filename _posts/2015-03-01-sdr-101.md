While researching Software Defined Radios and there use for creative and critical purposes I made a Github repository with helpful information for getting started.

If you're looking to play around with SDRs it might be of interest to you.

Here is the [repo](http://github.com/samatt/SDR-101)

The cover image is from an analog tv transmittor I made in collaboration with Jonathan Dahan for [Art Hack Day](http://www.arthackday.net/projects/jonathan-dahan-surya-mattu-wahd-tv).


And if you're looking for me talking about the subject with great enthusiasm you'll find one I gave for Radical Networks over [here](http://livestream.com/internetsociety/radicalnetworks/videos/102808507)
