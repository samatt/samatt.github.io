Pro-Bono I is a powered speaker that turns any input into a U2 song. It contains a high-quality powered speaker, a microcontroller and a computer. As soon as any input it receives begins playing, the speaker will emit a song from 'Songs of Innocence'. Why play anything else, ever? Pro Bono I was built as a response to Apple's hilarious and frightening decision to shove a U2 album into every working apple device, without telling users. We could lol, but we did a little more.
